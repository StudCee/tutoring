Thank you for helping make CACTuS a great system!

We highly recommend that you follow our guidelines. Issues/pull requests that
follow our guidelines are more likely to be addressed earlier and approved for
deployment.

There are many ways to contribute to CACTuS, such as becoming a tutor,
submitting bugs, writing documentation, improving the style of the source code,
fixing bugs, and working on new features. What the issue tracker is not meant
for however, are support request and questions. For those, please email
[tutoring@svcover.nl][email].

If you are unsure where to begin you can start by going through the [issue
tracker][issue tracker] to see if there are any changes you would feel
comfortable making. Otherwise, you can always improve the documentation.

# Submitting Bugs
If you find a security vulnerability, do **NOT** open an issue. Instead, [drop
us a line][email], so we can fix it without allowing people to exploit it.

For other bugs, you can [open an issue][new issue]. There you will find a number
of questions that we would like to see answered. If you also properly label your
issue we can recognise it easier and add it to our work flow. Please also make
sure that the bug that you are submitting has not been submitted before! If it
has been, feel free to leave a comment on that issue with the details of your
problem.

# Suggesting Features
If you want to suggest a new feature, you can use the issue tracker for that.
Please [make an issue][new issue] with a clear description of the suggested
feature, why it is needed, and how it should work. Please also check to see if
there are any similar suggestions, so you do not suggest something that has
already been suggested.

If you want to work on a feature that has not been discussed on the issues
tracker, please suggest it first. Then we know that you are working on this, and
we can go over potential implementations. We can then also see if it fits with
our vision of the system and suggest changes before you start working on it.

# Making Changes
For making changes to the code, we would like you to go through the following
process:

1. Create a fork of the repository. For instructions on how to setup the
   development environment, please check the [readme][readme].

2. Make the changes that you wanted to make.

3. Add/update the documentation for your new code.

4. Check to see if your new code adheres to our style guide (use `pylint` for
    this). Feel free to disable some warnings here and there, your judgement is
    probably better than our style guide from time to time.

5. Send in a pull request so we can review and incorporate your change.

We go through the new issues at least once every week (excluding vacations), so
it can happen that we do not reply immediately. If we have not gotten a reply
from you within two weeks, we might close the issue.
